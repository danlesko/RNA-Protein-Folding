# CMSC441-Project1


Worked with a partner to complete a variation of the Nussinov Protein Folding algorithm in Python and then a parallelized version of the algorithm in C++.

Running the program requires the data sequence (a text file) and a sequence length to be passed as command line arguments. 

Ex: 
./opt.py sample_data.txt 100
